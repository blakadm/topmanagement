                        At OneLab, we take the issue on privacy rights seriously. We make sure that all personal data that come into our possession are handled and protected in accordance with existing laws and regulations, including the Republic Act No. 10173, otherwise known as the Data Privacy Act of 2012.
                        This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, protect, and/or process customer information/personal data. This is also aimed at helping customers make an informed decision before they provide us with any of their personal data.
                        Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Should you have any questions or concerns, please see the “Contact Us” detail at the end of this policy.

                        As used in this Policy, Personal Data refers to any information from which the identity of a customer can be reasonably and directly ascertained by any person who has access to the same, whether taken individually or collectively.
                       When a customer submits a sample/s at any OneLab laboratory, the personal information we collect may include:</div>

                         <div align="justify" style='text-indent:30px'>Customers must provide only those pieces of information which are accurate and not misleading. It is assumed that when a customer provides personal information of a third party or of a firm owned by another, said customer has obtained the required consent from the concerned third party or is fully authorized to do the same by the firm. OneLab, however, reserves the right to request for supporting documentation to verify any information provided by a customer.
                        When customers browse our website, they generally do so anonymously, without them being required to provide any personal information, except when they submit sample/s and have to login to the Customer Portal to check the status of their requests in which case, personal information is needed in order for the request to be processed.</div>
